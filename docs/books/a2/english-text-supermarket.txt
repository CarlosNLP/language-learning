We usually go to the supermarket on Saturday mornings.
Martha is at the grocery store, getting ready for a house party. She has a list of what she needs with her as she goes along. The first section she comes has produce. Martha sees apples, bananas, cherries, grapes, and strawberries. She checks her list.
Six apples are included in the shopping list.
We need to get one bag of cherries for the picnic.
Let's buy a bag of grapes for New Year's Eve.
She got two cartons of strawberries for the breakfast.
Martha get her items and looks the bananas. They are on sale for much cheaper than they are normally. She picks 3 bananas. Next are vegetables. She sees potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, and salad in bags.
Five pounds of potatoes.
As she is putting her items into her cart, Martha checks the many bags of salad and chooses two of them.
She pushes her cart ahead. The next section is meat and dairy. She sees meat, fish, cheese, eggs, and milk.
We need to buy a block of cheddar cheese.
He bought one dozen eggs for the Spanish omelette.
Two gallons of milk are needed for the cake.
She looks at the meat that is on sale and chooses a 5-pound roll of hamburger. She gets the rest of the items in that section. She still needs rice, bread, salt, sugar, and flour.
Martha then realizes that she has forgotten something. She runs back and gets one container of salt and then rushes to the checkout. She puts her groceries into her car and leaves.
